The variable block you provided is used to define a map of subnet configurations in Terraform. Here's a breakdown of the variable block:

```hcl
variable "subnet-config" {
  type    = map(object({
    Name                    = string
    cidr_block              = string
    vpc-id                  = string
    availabilityzone        = optional(string)
    map_public_ip_on_launch = optional(bool)
  }))
  default = {
    def-subnet-1 = {
      Name                    = "terraformDefaultName"
      cidr_block              = "10.10.0.0/22"
      vpc-id                  = "provided-vpc-id"
      availabilityzone        = "ap-south-1a"
      map_public_ip_on_launch = false
    }
  }
}
```

The variable block defines a variable named "subnet-config" of type `map(object(...))`. The map contains key-value pairs where the keys are strings and the values are objects with specific attributes. Here's a description of the attributes within the object type:

- `Name`: A string representing the name of the subnet.
- `cidr_block`: A string representing the CIDR block for the subnet.
- `vpc-id`: A string representing the ID of the VPC to which the subnet belongs.
- `availabilityzone`: An optional string representing the availability zone for the subnet.
- `map_public_ip_on_launch`: An optional boolean indicating whether to assign a public IP address to instances launched in the subnet.

The `default` attribute within the variable block provides a default value for the variable. In this case, it defines a single entry in the map with the key "def-subnet-1" and the corresponding subnet configuration values.

This variable block allows you to define multiple subnet configurations by adding additional entries to the `default` map or by passing values from other sources, such as input variables or data sources.

Please note that the actual default values and requirements may vary depending on your specific use case. Make sure to adjust the values and requirements according to your needs.
