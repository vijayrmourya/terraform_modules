The provided code snippet represents another Terraform variable block, this time for defining the configuration parameters of an EC2 key pair. Let's break down each variable and provide an explanation along with an example usage:

1. `ec2_key_config` (variable name): This is the name of the variable block.

2. `type` (attribute): Specifies the type of the variable. Here, it is defined as a map of objects.

3. `algorithm` (variable): Represents the encryption algorithm used for generating the key pair. It is of type string.

4. `rsa_bits` (variable): Specifies the number of bits to be used for the RSA key pair. It is of type number.

5. `Key_Name` (variable): Refers to the desired name for the key pair. It is of type string.

6. `keyStorePath` (variable): Represents the path or location where the generated key pair will be stored. It is of type string.

7. `file_permission` (variable): Specifies the permissions or access rights for the stored key pair file. It is of type string.

8. `default` (attribute): Specifies the default value for the variable. In this case, it is an empty map ({}), indicating that no default values are set.

Example usage:

```
ec2_key_config = {
  algorithm       = "RSA"
  rsa_bits        = 2048
  Key_Name        = "my-keypair"
  keyStorePath    = "/path/to/store/key"
  file_permission = "0600"
}
```

In this example, the variables are assigned specific values. The key pair will be generated using the RSA algorithm with 2048 bits. The key pair will have the name "my-keypair" and will be stored at the path "/path/to/store/key". The file permission for the key pair file will be set to "0600", which grants read and write access to the owner only.

These variables can be used in a Terraform configuration to define and manage EC2 key pairs.
